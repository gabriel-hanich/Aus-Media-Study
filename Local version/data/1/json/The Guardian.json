Premier Gladys Berejiklian did not attend the press conference, with today's Covid update provided by NSW Health's Dr&amp;nbsp;Jeremy McAnulty. Although the state's numbers have seen a small decrease, McAnulty said 'it\u2019s too early to know if we\u2019re flattening the curve'. He said it was pleasing that 'cases haven\u2019t been increasing as fast as they have been' but could be a reflection of the slowing weekend test rates. 'We\u2019ll look to see what\u2019s happening throughout the rest of this week to know how we\u2019re going'.",

A handball from Luke Shaw had offered West Ham the chance to salvage a draw during an extraordinary finale and, in fairness to David Moyes, he thought he was on to a sure thing. Noble had taken 42 penalties since turning professional and missed just four; in fact he had not fluffed his lines since 2016. So Moyes turned to his one-man cavalry and, barely breaking stride, Noble jogged from the substitutes\u2019 bench to the spot.",

Powell was a retired four-star general who served as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in the early 1990s, before joining the George W Bush administration as secretary of state. Before the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, Powell made the case to the United Nations security council that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had biological weapons and was developing nuclear weapons. He later said that this represented 'a blot' that will 'always be a part of my record'. Although he was a Republican, in 2008 he endorsed Barack Obama for president. In the years that followed, he felt increasingly detached from the party, ultimately leaving it in the wake of the 6 January insurrection on the Capitol",

The samples have to be collected before they spawn which occurs only once a year, several days after a full moon in spring.
