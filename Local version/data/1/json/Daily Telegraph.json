The tomb, which was modeled after British and French memorials of the same nature and opened in 1921, holds the remains of an unknown soldier from World War I and is intended to represent all US servicepeople who were killed and could not be identified. (Remains of unknown soldiers from World War II and Korea were interred at the site later.) It is guarded 24/7 by a soldier from the US 3rd Infantry Regiment, also known as The Old Guard. The tomb plaza was to be open to the public for wreath-laying from November 9 through 11 to mark the centennial. Video streamed live by the US Armed Forces on Tuesday shows the changing of the guard before dignitaries from the Crow Nation and members of the public approached to lay flowers and pay their respects.

Footage filmed by Paul Bellman of St John Ambulance Service NT shows the man being hoisted away from the car, which was trapped against a tree in the river, and onto a footbridge using a system of ropes. Local reports citing ambulance services said the driver, a 33-year-old man, was in good condition after his ordeal, but suffering from exhaustion. The Bureau of Meteorology said 95.8 mm (3.8 inches) of rain fell at Alice Springs airport over a 24-hour period November 9 to 10, the highest such total since 2001.

Oklahoma State Representative Jacob Rosecrants posted this video capturing the cheers from inside the state capitol rotunda on Thursday after the news broke. Protesters had gathered at the state capitol building and the governor\u2019s mansion overnight demanding that Oklahoma Gov Kevin Stitt commute Jones\u2019s sentence. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, citing doubts about Jones\u2019s guilt, had voted 3-1 to ask Stitt to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment. Jones had been placed on death row after he was convicted for the murder of businessman Paul Howell in 1999. Jones\u2019s sentence is now life without the possibility of parole, Stitt said in a tweet. Credit: Jacob Rosecrants via Storyful",

Amess was stabbed to death during a meeting with constituents in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on October 15. Ali Harbi Ali, 25, was charged on October 21 with the murder of Amess and preparation of terrorist acts. This footage, posted by the Southend-on-Sea Borough Council, shows the MP\u2019s coffin being carried through the town. Amess\u2019s family released a statement, which was read by politician Ann Widdecombe during the service. The statement, published by local news outlet The Echo, said: \u201cStrong and courageous is an appropriate way to describe David. He was a patriot and a man of peace. So, we ask people to set aside their differences and show kindness and love to all. This is the only way forward. Set aside hatred and work towards togetherness. Whatever one\u2019s race, religious or political beliefs, be tolerant and try to understand. As a family, we are trying to understand why this awful thing has occurred. Nobody should die in that way.\u201d A second funeral service will take place on Tuesday, November 23, in Westminster Cathedral. Credit: Southend-on-Sea Borough Council via Storyful",
