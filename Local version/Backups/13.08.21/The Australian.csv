Neither is it a reflection on how much a commitment means to me. I often joke that if left to my own devices, I would show up at the wrong church for my own wedding. So, to cut my losses I got engaged to a film producer. He proposed during ‘golden hour’, aka that brief period of respite in between lockdowns last year, when most of us still thought that second waves and variants were nothing but pessimistic hearsay.

Great Scott,"The mystery of a $13,000 loan from a Chinese businessman to Labor’s City of Sydney mayoral candidate Linda Scott has taken a turn for the truly bizarre. At the centre of the puzzle is the identity of the lender, one Yuxing Li of Burwood. As The Australian’s Max Maddison has reported, Li gave Scott three loans – one eight days before local government elections in September 2016 and the others well after polling day in July 2017 – for reasons that are unclear. Yuxing Li, it turns out, is also the name of the chief executive of Dahua Group, one of the largest property developers in the city. According to records held by the corporate regulator, these men are one and the same. Scott, as it happens, voted in December 2016 for a major apartment project that Dahua is heavily involved in. But here is the truly baffling aspect of the tale. The man from Dahua, Yuxing Li of Pymble, swears he has never even met Scott and certainly has no connection to an address above a beauty parlour in Burwood. And he’s serious – Li even signed a statutory declaration after being questioned by this august organ. According to Dahua, it is entirely an error by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. So what was the loan for, and who is the Yuxing Li behind the money? Scott remains tight-lipped but adamant she’s done nothing wrong. “To my recollection and knowledge I have never spoken to Mr Li about any matter related to any development. My understanding is that Mr Li has previously confirmed that he was not a prohibited donor,” she said. Her running mate at the last election, Jonathan Yee, said he’s also never met any Yuxing Li. Yee was, for the record, drawn into the Chinese Friends of Labor corruption inquiry after being accused of using straw donors to disguise cash that was allegedly donated by banned property developer Huang Xiangmo. A mystery indeed. We’re not holding our breath to get answers before Scott faces off against stalwart Clover Moore for the mayoral chains on September 4.",None found,"Sun, 04 Jul 2021 07:50:00 +0000"

TV tradie Barry Du Bois is the latest high-profile candidate to throw his spirit level in the ring. He plans to face off against former TV chef Pete Evans for one of six NSW Senate seats. Echoing the words of Democrats founder Don Chipp, the resident builder from Ten’s lifestyle show The Living Room has promised he will “keep the bastards honest” if elected as an independent. Du Bois launched his “Team Baz” campaign on Sunday, but the 61-year-old cancer survivor has yet to register a political party with the AEC. “I have been approached by both Labor and the Liberal Party to run as an ­independent for safe seats,” he claimed. “I am not interested in that because three years ago they gave me five years to live. That is not my sentence, I will be here as long as it takes to do what I have to do.” Du Bois also borrowed the Scott Morrison’s idea of Quiet Australians, saying he wanted average people to prosper, “not just the privileged few with money and influence”. “I don’t care if you’re a shooter, a fisherman, a vegan, an Instagram influencer, digging ore, laying tiles, nursing, teaching, throwing punches in the ring, a retiree, a university graduate, or a CEO … we’re all in this together.”",None found,"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 07:49:00 +0000"

Carbon dating,"The novel coronavirus hasn’t slowed down the social scene in the Canberra Bubble™, with the ACT Young Liberals hosting a Midwinter Ball at Hotel Realm on Saturday night. Tickets started at $160 for members, with corporate sponsorship tiered from silver, $200,   to platinum, $600. Oddly, it was Queensland senator Amanda Stoker’s chief of staff who forked out for premier billing in the dinner program. Strewth hears one individual paid $2600 during the fundraiser for a literal lump of coal from the Carmichael Bravis mine (formerly known as Adani). And no, it wasn’t Scott Morrison. ACT Liberal senator Zed Seselja kicked off the three-course dinner by saying Grace. A dig at Victorian Reason Party leader Fiona Pattern, who wants to replace the state parliament’s 103-year-old Lord’s Prayer tradition with a non-denominational moment of silence. “God is now subject to cancel culture!” Victorian Liberal leader Michael O’Brien cried last week. However, many of the lubricated young conservatives in the room didn’t appear to share Seselja’s passion of the Christ, and jeered “here, here!” throughout. Local Liberal leader Elizabeth Lee was there, as was her TikTok-loving MP Mark Parton, who was booted from parliament last week after he feel fowl of the territory’s code of conduct over a KFC TikTok. The Father of the House Kevin Andrews delivered the keynote speech, potentially one of the 65-year-old’s last as an elected member. South Australian MP Tony Pasin told the crowd that the biggest achievement of Andrews’ 30-year political career was deposing Malcolm Turnbull. One table of Moderates booed.
