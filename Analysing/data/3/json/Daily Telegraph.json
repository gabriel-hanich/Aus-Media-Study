By flattening some ground and “moving obstacles”, the firefighters said they hoped to channel the lava into a ravine, saving buildings in the town of Todoque. Around 200 buildings in the path of the lava have been destroyed, following the September 19 eruption of the island’s Cumbre Vieja volcano, Telecinco said. Around 6,000 people have been evacuated, the news site said. Credit: Bomberos Gran Canaria via Storyful",

Thomas Fisher told Storyful that he was casting in the bay on Friday afternoon when he spotted the whale. Fisher said the whale came up around five or six times. Humpback whales have been spotted several times in recent years in waters off New York City. In December 2020, a whale was seen in the Hudson River, exciting locals.

Ashamed that I’d never be able to do what I love and be gay.” In the video, which was posted through Adelaide United’s social media profiles, he added that “All I want to do is play football and be treated equally.” Cavallo enthused about the “immense” support he has gotten since coming out, saying “I know there are other football players living in silence. I want to change this.” In a statement, Adelaide United Football Club said “Adelaide United, not only as a football club, but as the embodiment of an inclusive community, supports a remarkable and brave person.” Credit: Josh Cavallo/Adelaide United Football Club via Storyful",

(Remains of unknown soldiers from World War II and Korea were interred at the site later.) It is guarded 24/7 by a soldier from the US 3rd Infantry Regiment, also known as The Old Guard. The tomb plaza was to be open to the public for wreath-laying from November 9 through 11 to mark the centennial. Video streamed live by the US Armed Forces on Tuesday shows the changing of the guard before dignitaries from the Crow Nation and members of the public approached to lay flowers and pay their respects.

Footage filmed by Paul Bellman of St John Ambulance Service NT shows the man being hoisted away from the car, which was trapped against a tree in the river, and onto a footbridge using a system of ropes. Local reports citing ambulance services said the driver, a 33-year-old man, was in good condition after his ordeal, but suffering from exhaustion. The Bureau of Meteorology said 95.8 mm (3.8 inches) of rain fell at Alice Springs airport over a 24-hour period November 9 to 10, the highest such total since 2001.

Jones had been placed on death row after he was convicted for the murder of businessman Paul Howell in 1999. Credit: Tyler Talley via Storyful",

Amess was stabbed to death during a meeting with constituents in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on October 15. Ali Harbi Ali, 25, was charged on October 21 with the murder of Amess and preparation of terrorist acts. This footage, posted by the Southend-on-Sea Borough Council, shows the MP’s coffin being carried through the town. Amess’s family released a statement, which was read by politician Ann Widdecombe during the service. The statement, published by local news outlet The Echo, said: “Strong and courageous is an appropriate way to describe David. He was a patriot and a man of peace. So, we ask people to set aside their differences and show kindness and love to all. This is the only way forward. Set aside hatred and work towards togetherness. Whatever one’s race, religious or political beliefs, be tolerant and try to understand. As a family, we are trying to understand why this awful thing has occurred. Nobody should die in that way.” A second funeral service will take place on Tuesday, November 23, in Westminster Cathedral. Credit: Southend-on-Sea Borough Council via Storyful",

            "description": "Members of environmental activist group Greenpeace scaled a ship docked at Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on December 10 in a protest against deep-sea mining as governments met in Jamaica “to discuss opening up the seafloor to mining,” the group said. Footage from Greenpeace showed the activists approaching the ship, named the Hidden Gem, on a boat, before rappelling up the side of the ship and unfurling banners reading: “No Deep Sea Mining”. The Hidden Gem, a 228-meter-long former drilling ship operated by The Metals Company, arrived in Rotterdam on September 21. The Metals Company said it would be converted “into what is expected to be the first ship classified as a sub-sea mining vessel by the American Bureau of Shipping,” a maritime classification society. Metals Company CEO and Chairman Gerard Bannon said the ship would be tested during a “pilot mining project in 2022.” According to the Canadian company’s website, the ship would be seeking “metals from seafloor polymetallic nodules” to make electric vehicle batteries. Greenpeace Netherlands activist Samuel Gosschal, who took part in the protest in Rotterdam, said, “Make no mistake, this monster machine is built for profit: nothing else. It’s not for delicately exploring the seafloor – it’s for profit at the expense of nature,” according to a press release from Greenpeace. Greenpeace said it took the action as governments were meeting at the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in Jamaica “to discuss opening up the seafloor to mining in less than two years’ time.” A day before the protest, the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), Michael Lodge, delivered a report on the ISA’s progress to the United Nations General Assembly. Lodge told the UN that the ISA’s goal was to promote “equity and economic and social solidarity in access to and sustainable management of the mineral wealth of the deep seabed” but with adherence to “strict regulations” to ensure resources are used sustainably “and in a way that provides long-term benefits for all.” Greenpeace, however, says scientists have warned that “allowing deep sea mining to start would be catastrophic for seafloor ecosystems and the health of the ocean, including potential species extinctions and disruptions to carbon storage, worsening the climate crisis.” Credit: Greenpeace via Storyful",

            "description": "The National Weather Service confirmed at least 21 tornadoes impacted four states in the central US on December 15, during an unprecedented storm that brought weather warnings to some 100 million Americans and killed at least five. The high-wind storm system, known as a derecho, brought hurricane-force winds, dust storms, wildfires, snow squalls, and heavy rain across the middle of the country, and spawned tornadoes in Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and Iowa, where authorities had confirmed 13 twisters touched down. This animation, released by NASA, shows the storm system developing from late on December 14 and sweeping across the United States on December 15 into the early hours of December 16. “The derecho was spawned by the interaction of a deep-low pressure system over the Northern High Plains and a high-pressure system to the west,” NASA said. “This created a tight pressure gradient over the Rocky Mountains that generated fierce winds. The storm generated at least 55 hurricane-force gusts (those exceeding 75 miles per hour), breaking the previous one-day record (since tracking began in 2004). All previous records were set during the summer months.” Credit: NASA via Storyful",

            "description": "Two people were arrested after an incident escalated into a brawl at Miami International Airport in Florida on the evening of December 20, police said. A statement from Miami-Dade Police said the department was investigating the incident, during which an officer was “bitten on the head.” “According to investigators, officers responded to Gate H8 after a call from an airport employee. The employee advised that as he was driving a transport cart, an unruly passenger refused to let him through, entered the cart, broke the key and refused to exit the cart. As the responding officers attempted to calm the subject, who refused to exit the cart, a physical confrontation between the subject and the officers ensued, and a large crowd surrounded the officers. Additional officers responded and the subject was placed under arrest. An additional involved subject was identified and arrested,” police said in the statement. Additional video from the incident shows the man, identified by police as Mayfrer Serranopaca, standing on the cart and touching one of the officers, who then grabbed him and pulled him into a chokehold. Other passengers were seen physically intervening between the two. Serranopaca, 30, and Alberto Suarez, 32, were arrested, police said. Miami International Airport released a statement to Storyful from CEO Ralph Cutie: “Like airports across the country, MIA is seeing record-high passenger numbers this winter travel season. Unfortunately, that passenger growth has come with a record-high increase nationwide in bad behavior as well, such as the incident this evening at MIA. Disruptive passengers face police arrest, civil penalties up to $37,000, being banned from flying, and potential federal prosecution. We have worked so hard to rebound from the pandemic and make traveling safe again, so we can visit our loved ones. Please travel responsibly by getting to the airport extra early, being patient, complying with the federal mask law and airport staff, limiting your alcohol consumption, and notifying police at the first sign of bad behavior by calling 911.” This footage, filmed by Mike Majlak, shows part of the brawl that ensued between police and passengers near Gate H7 on Monday night. The footage shows an officer holding Serranopaca in a chokehold while passengers surround them. Serranopaca breaks free and engages the officer again, at which point the officer draws his firearm.
