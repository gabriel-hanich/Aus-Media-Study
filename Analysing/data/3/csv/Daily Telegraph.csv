Whatever one’s race, religious or political beliefs, be tolerant and try to understand. As a family, we are trying to understand why this awful thing has occurred.

Greenpeace Activists Scale Ship in Rotterdam to Protest Deep Sea Mining,"Members of environmental activist group Greenpeace scaled a ship docked at Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on December 10 in a protest against deep-sea mining as governments met in Jamaica “to discuss opening up the seafloor to mining,” the group said. Footage from Greenpeace showed the activists approaching the ship, named the Hidden Gem, on a boat, before rappelling up the side of the ship and unfurling banners reading: “No Deep Sea Mining”. The Hidden Gem, a 228-meter-long former drilling ship operated by The Metals Company, arrived in Rotterdam on September 21. The Metals Company said it would be converted “into what is expected to be the first ship classified as a sub-sea mining vessel by the American Bureau of Shipping,” a maritime classification society. Metals Company CEO and Chairman Gerard Bannon said the ship would be tested during a “pilot mining project in 2022.” According to the Canadian company’s website, the ship would be seeking “metals from seafloor polymetallic nodules” to make electric vehicle batteries. Greenpeace Netherlands activist Samuel Gosschal, who took part in the protest in Rotterdam, said, “Make no mistake, this monster machine is built for profit: nothing else. It’s not for delicately exploring the seafloor – it’s for profit at the expense of nature,” according to a press release from Greenpeace. Greenpeace said it took the action as governments were meeting at the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in Jamaica “to discuss opening up the seafloor to mining in less than two years’ time.” A day before the protest, the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), Michael Lodge, delivered a report on the ISA’s progress to the United Nations General Assembly. Lodge told the UN that the ISA’s goal was to promote “equity and economic and social solidarity in access to and sustainable management of the mineral wealth of the deep seabed” but with adherence to “strict regulations” to ensure resources are used sustainably “and in a way that provides long-term benefits for all.” Greenpeace, however, says scientists have warned that “allowing deep sea mining to start would be catastrophic for seafloor ecosystems and the health of the ocean, including potential species extinctions and disruptions to carbon storage, worsening the climate crisis.” Credit: Greenpeace via Storyful",None found,"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 19:49:09 +0000"

Timelapse Animation Shows Deadly Derecho Sweep Across United States,"The National Weather Service confirmed at least 21 tornadoes impacted four states in the central US on December 15, during an unprecedented storm that brought weather warnings to some 100 million Americans and killed at least five. The high-wind storm system, known as a derecho, brought hurricane-force winds, dust storms, wildfires, snow squalls, and heavy rain across the middle of the country, and spawned tornadoes in Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and Iowa, where authorities had confirmed 13 twisters touched down. This animation, released by NASA, shows the storm system developing from late on December 14 and sweeping across the United States on December 15 into the early hours of December 16. “The derecho was spawned by the interaction of a deep-low pressure system over the Northern High Plains and a high-pressure system to the west,” NASA said. “This created a tight pressure gradient over the Rocky Mountains that generated fierce winds. The storm generated at least 55 hurricane-force gusts (those exceeding 75 miles per hour), breaking the previous one-day record (since tracking began in 2004). All previous records were set during the summer months.” Credit: NASA via Storyful",None found,"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 19:42:09 +0000"

"Fight Breaks Out Between Passengers, Police at Miami International Airport","Two people were arrested after an incident escalated into a brawl at Miami International Airport in Florida on the evening of December 20, police said. A statement from Miami-Dade Police said the department was investigating the incident, during which an officer was “bitten on the head.” “According to investigators, officers responded to Gate H8 after a call from an airport employee. The employee advised that as he was driving a transport cart, an unruly passenger refused to let him through, entered the cart, broke the key and refused to exit the cart. As the responding officers attempted to calm the subject, who refused to exit the cart, a physical confrontation between the subject and the officers ensued, and a large crowd surrounded the officers. Additional officers responded and the subject was placed under arrest. An additional involved subject was identified and arrested,” police said in the statement. Additional video from the incident shows the man, identified by police as Mayfrer Serranopaca, standing on the cart and touching one of the officers, who then grabbed him and pulled him into a chokehold. Other passengers were seen physically intervening between the two. Serranopaca, 30, and Alberto Suarez, 32, were arrested, police said. Miami International Airport released a statement to Storyful from CEO Ralph Cutie: “Like airports across the country, MIA is seeing record-high passenger numbers this winter travel season. Unfortunately, that passenger growth has come with a record-high increase nationwide in bad behavior as well, such as the incident this evening at MIA. Disruptive passengers face police arrest, civil penalties up to $37,000, being banned from flying, and potential federal prosecution. We have worked so hard to rebound from the pandemic and make traveling safe again, so we can visit our loved ones. Please travel responsibly by getting to the airport extra early, being patient, complying with the federal mask law and airport staff, limiting your alcohol consumption, and notifying police at the first sign of bad behavior by calling 911.” This footage, filmed by Mike Majlak, shows part of the brawl that ensued between police and passengers near Gate H7 on Monday night. The footage shows an officer holding Serranopaca in a chokehold while passengers surround them. Serranopaca breaks free and engages the officer again, at which point the officer draws his firearm.
