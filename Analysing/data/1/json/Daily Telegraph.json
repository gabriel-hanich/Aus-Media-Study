Ashamed that I’d never be able to do what I love and be gay.” In the video, which was posted through Adelaide United’s social media profiles, he added that “All I want to do is play football and be treated equally.” Cavallo enthused about the “immense” support he has gotten since coming out, saying “I know there are other football players living in silence. I want to change this.” In a statement, Adelaide United Football Club said “Adelaide United, not only as a football club, but as the embodiment of an inclusive community, supports a remarkable and brave person.” Credit: Josh Cavallo/Adelaide United Football Club via Storyful",

The tomb, which was modeled after British and French memorials of the same nature and opened in 1921, holds the remains of an unknown soldier from World War I and is intended to represent all US servicepeople who were killed and could not be identified. (Remains of unknown soldiers from World War II and Korea were interred at the site later.) It is guarded 24/7 by a soldier from the US 3rd Infantry Regiment, also known as The Old Guard. The tomb plaza was to be open to the public for wreath-laying from November 9 through 11 to mark the centennial. Video streamed live by the US Armed Forces on Tuesday shows the changing of the guard before dignitaries from the Crow Nation and members of the public approached to lay flowers and pay their respects.

The Bureau of Meteorology said 95.8 mm (3.8 inches) of rain fell at Alice Springs airport over a 24-hour period November 9 to 10, the highest such total since 2001.

Protesters had gathered at the state capitol building and the governor’s mansion overnight demanding that Oklahoma Gov Kevin Stitt commute Jones’s sentence. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, citing doubts about Jones’s guilt, had voted 3-1 to ask Stitt to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment. Jones had been placed on death row after he was convicted for the murder of businessman Paul Howell in 1999. Jones’s sentence is now life without the possibility of parole, Stitt said in a tweet.

Amess was stabbed to death during a meeting with constituents in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on October 15. Ali Harbi Ali, 25, was charged on October 21 with the murder of Amess and preparation of terrorist acts. This footage, posted by the Southend-on-Sea Borough Council, shows the MP’s coffin being carried through the town. Amess’s family released a statement, which was read by politician Ann Widdecombe during the service. The statement, published by local news outlet The Echo, said: “Strong and courageous is an appropriate way to describe David. He was a patriot and a man of peace. So, we ask people to set aside their differences and show kindness and love to all. This is the only way forward. Set aside hatred and work towards togetherness. Whatever one’s race, religious or political beliefs, be tolerant and try to understand. As a family, we are trying to understand why this awful thing has occurred. Nobody should die in that way.” A second funeral service will take place on Tuesday, November 23, in Westminster Cathedral. Credit: Southend-on-Sea Borough Council via Storyful",
