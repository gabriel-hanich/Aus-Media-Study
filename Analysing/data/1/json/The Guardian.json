A handball from Luke Shaw had offered West Ham the chance to salvage a draw during an extraordinary finale and, in fairness to David Moyes, he thought he was on to a sure thing. Noble had taken 42 penalties since turning professional and missed just four; in fact he had not fluffed his lines since 2016. So Moyes turned to his one-man cavalry and, barely breaking stride, Noble jogged from the substitutes’ bench to the spot.",

More than 85% of over-16s in the state have now received at least their first dose of a Covid vaccination. Berejiklian announced a three-stage roadmap out of lockdown, beginning when the state reaches 70% double-dose vaccinations for over-16s, which she says will be by 11 October. At 80% double-dose vaccination rate, 10 people will be allowed to visit a home, regional travel will be allowed, vaccinated people will be allowed to go to the pub and community sport will restart. The third stage of reopening will kick in on 1 December when the 4 sq metre rule for public places moves to 2 sq metres and other restrictions are eased",

Powell was a retired four-star general who served as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in the early 1990s, before joining the George W Bush administration as secretary of state. Before the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, Powell made the case to the United Nations security council that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had biological weapons and was developing nuclear weapons. He later said that this represented 'a blot' that will 'always be a part of my record'. Although he was a Republican, in 2008 he endorsed Barack Obama for president. In the years that followed, he felt increasingly detached from the party, ultimately leaving it in the wake of the 6 January insurrection on the Capitol",

Australian painter Lucy Culliton discovered it while sorting through the belongings of her late father, former television director Tony Culliton, at the family’s home in the Blue Mountains. Hiding at the back of a shelf were a handful of reel-to-reel audio tapes – one was marked ‘Easybeats print – Friday On My Mind’. The survival rate of 1960s&amp;nbsp;Top of the Pops&amp;nbsp;editions remains extremely low. Of the 315 episodes produced from 1964 to the end of the decade, only five complete episodes are understood to have survived. ",
